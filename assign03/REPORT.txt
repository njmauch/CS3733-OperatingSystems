1) I did not collaborate with anyone on this project.
2) I do think I did everything correct
3) N/A
4) At first i was getting a segmentation fault in part 2 but then quickly realised i was setting my lru victin to the clk
and returning that as the index.  After that I had an issue of where i was keeping track of my fault count.  Nothing major
and easily fixed.
