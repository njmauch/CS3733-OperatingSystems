 * Second one (say driver2.c) gets two command-line arguments: 
 * driver2 input_file.txt output_file.txt 
 * input_file.txt is a text file containig many lines. 
 *
 * Your program reads each line from the input file and removes 
 * the extra space characters between the words in that line. 
 * Then it prints the new line into output_file.txt.  
 * So there will be at most one space character between the words in 
 * each line of output_file.txt. 
 * Remove all the space characters from the begining and end of the string as well. 
 * Leave only one space character between the words. 
 * Use only the space character as a seperator, so any other sequence of charcters 
 * are treated like a word (e.g., "   aa    3c   %$3a    " has three words, 
 * after removing the extra space characters you should have "aa 3c %$3a")
