  * Function: ReadInteger
  * Usage: i = ReadInteger();
  * ------------------------
  * ReadInteger reads a line of text from standard input and scans
  * it as an integer. To read the line, you can call the ReadLine()
  * function that is described below. If all the characters in the
  * given line are digits, then convert it to an integer and
  * return it. The very first character could be the sign character
  * '-' or '+'.
  * Otherwise, if the given string contains any other character,
  * this function will give an error meassage and keep asking user
  * to enter a valid sequnece of characters that can be converted to
  * an integer.
  * The followings are valid integers: 234, -345, +453.
  * The followings are not valid integers: 34  5, 3afg, 3-3, --45.

/*
 * Function: ReadDouble
 * Usage: x = ReadDouble();
 * ---------------------
 * ReadDouble reads a line of text from standard input and scans
 * it as a double.  As described above, you can call ReadLine() to
 * read the line. If the number cannot be scanned as double or if
 * extra characters follow after the number ends, this function
 * gives an error and keep asking user to enter a valid double.
 * The followings are valid doubless: 24, -35, +43, -23.54, +45.3
 * The followings are not valid doubles: 34  5, 3afg, 3.3.3, --45.5

/*
 * Function: ReadLine
 * Usage: s = ReadLine();
 * ---------------------
 * ReadLine reads a line of text from standard input and returns
 * the line as a string.  The newline character that terminates
 * the input is not stored as part of the string.

/*
 * Function: ReadLineFile
 * Usage: s = ReadLineFile(infile);
 * ----------------------------
 * ReadLineFile reads a line of text from the input file which
 * is already open and pointed by infile. It then reads the line,
 * dynamically allocates space, and returns the line as a string.
 * The newline character that terminates the input is not stored
 * as part of the string.
 * The ReadLineFile function returns NULL if infile is at the
 * end-of-file position.
 * Note: the above ReadLine(); can simply be implemented as
 *  char *ReadLine() { return(ReadLineFile(stdin)); }
